Description: Macro and Template saving, lookup and launch script for VIM. 
Version:     0.3 Beta

Justification: Helps us VIM users to store complex VIM macros 
and templates into persistent storage for future search and load.

Features:

    * Recording of VIM macros into persistent storage for future use
    * Quick search based recall and load of stored VIM macros
    * Visually select and save templates into persistent storage
    * Quick search based insert of stored templates
    * Recursive search of macro repository directories 
    * Macro namespaces, supporting the organization of macros 
      (in sub-directories)
    * Supports a shared macro repository for a team on a shared directory
    * Cross share your macros with other users by copying repositories 
    * Macro menu items for all main actions

Installation
------------

o Download Marvim to your VIM plugin ($VIMRUNTIME/plugin) directory 
  or source it explicity. Below is an example if you place it in 
  the home directory

  source $HOME/marvim.vim 

o Configure Macro with different macro hotkeys (default F2,F3), 
  repository location (see below) or macro register (deault register q)

  let marvim_store = '/usr/local/share/projectX/marvim'
  let marvim_find_key = '<Space>'
  let marvim_store_key = 'ms'
  let marvim_register = 'c'

o Start vim and this will automatically create the base marvim macro 
  repository in your home directory. Based on the OS it will be 
  located as follows:

  UNIX      ~/.marvim  
  WINDOWS   C:\Document and Settings\Username\marvim 

o (optional) Copy predefined macro/template directories into the base 
  marvin macro directory. Marvim uses recursive directory search so 
  you can nest the directories as you wish.
       
Default Hotkeys
---------------
  <F2>        - Find and execute a macro or insert template from repository
  Visual <F2> - Replays last macro for each line selected
  <F3>        - Save default macro register by name to the macro repository 
  Visual <F3> - Save selection as template by name to the macro repository 

Tips
----
 o <Space> can be very effective as the macro find key
 o use a naming convention for your macros to make it easy to find. e.g.:

   php:if-block
   php:strip-tags
   php:mysql-select-block
   php:mysql-update-block
