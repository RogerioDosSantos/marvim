Description: Macro and Template saving, lookup and launch script for VIM. 
Version:     0.1 Alpha
Date:        13 FEB 2008
Copyright:   Chamindra de Silva 
License:     GPL v2

Justification: Helps us forgetful/lazy types to store complex VIM 
macros and templates that we frequently use into persistent storage 
in form of a repository for future search and usage.

Features:

    * Recording of VIM macros into persistent storage for future use
    * Quick search based recall and load of stored VIM macros
    * Visually select and save templates into persistent storage
    * Quick search based insert of stored templates

Installation:

   1. Download marvim.vim from the download link
   2. Save marvim into your VIM script directory
   3. Create a directory .marvim in your home directory to store your 
      macros and templates.
   4. (optional) modify the hotkeys in the marvim.vim script after 
      the ==HOTKEYS== line

Usage:

    * <F2>  - SAVE MACRO stored in 'c' register by name to a macro 
              directory in normal mode
    * Visual <F2> - SAVE a TEMPLATE by name to the macro directory 
                    in visual mode
    * <F3>  - search and EXECUTE a MACRO or insert TEMPLATE in the 
              macro directory. Load the MACRO into 'c' register for later use
    * Visual <F3> - in visual mode REPLAYS last loaded MACRO for each line

Hints:

    * Some examples scripts are included for you to copy to your
      marvim script directory and recall
    * Decide on a naming convention for your macros and templates 
      to make it easy for the search.
    * Macro register 'c' is used by default but you can change this 
      by modifying the s:macro_register variable
    * You can change the hotkeys <F3>, <F2> by modifying the 4 lines 
      after '==HOTKEYS==' in the script

If you like it please send patches, template/macro repositories 
and improvements to the script to http://chamindra.googlepages.com/marvim
